# EZ License
Makes acquiring the US driver's license a piece of cake for new immigrants.

## Problem it solves


One of the biggest challenges newly arriving immigrants face is getting a US driver's license. Many new immigrants are seasoned drivers who have been driving in their native countries for several years. Several are international drivers permit holders who can drive all over the world and can quickly adapt to the US laws of driving. However, for obvious reasons, immigrants need to obtain a permanent driver's license. Taking the written test is typically easy and not an issue. The challenge arises in taking the driving test. To take the driving test, immigrants need a car. But without a valid US driver's license, there is no way for them to get one. It's a catch 22.

Car rental companies require you to have a valid US drivers license (besides the other age-related restrictions that impose an additional burden on younger immigrants). With a small social circle, new immigrants are typically unable to find anyone who is willing to 'lend' them a ride to take their driving test.

Such immigrants have no other choice but to call the driving schools. Unfortunately, these driving schools force them to purchase driving lessons from them before they feel comfortable renting their vehicle for the test. For experienced international drivers this is completely unnecessary and yet they do not have a choice. The driving lessons are anything but cheap. For new immigrants, getting a drivers license often translates to breaking the bank.

EZ license is a mobile platform that aims to solve this problem. It connects immigrants looking to acquire a US driver's license with individuals who are willing to teach driving and / or rent their vehicles to international drivers for a very minimal cost.
